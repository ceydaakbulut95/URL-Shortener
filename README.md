This project addresses the well-known design challenge of URL shortening. 
It generates short URLs by compressing Base64 using a ZooKeeper counter and UUID, resulting in a 7-character format. 
The entire application is containerized using Docker and developed in Java(openjdk:19-jdk).
Status: In Progress
